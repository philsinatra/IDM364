# State

^ Understanding the concept of states in React will allow you to build interesting, robust applications. Without states, your React components are glorified static templates. A _state_ is a description of the status of a system that is waiting to execute a transition. A transition is a set of actions to be executed when a condition is fulfilled or changed.

^ State is how to interact with your components. State is a special React object that determines how your component renders and behaves. State is what allows us to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

---

## An Analogy

^ To help explain this concept, consider a question: what's the difference between water and ice?

^ Temperature. Now, what is temperature? A measurement of thermal energy - keyword being measurement, because that implies it is tracked with a known value.

^ You can change the value on a thermometer, which means you have the ability to put a piece of matter into a different state. Put water in a freezer (below 32F) and its state will change from liquid to solid. Put it on a hot stovetop (above 212F), its state will change from liquid to gas. All of this can be done by changing one value: temperature.

^ We can do the same thing with programs. We can define a set of properties that determine how our program behaves in any situation, similar to water's relationship with temperature.

^ The concept of state in React derives from that of a _state machine_. Think about a turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides. It's a gate with rotating arms at waist height, one of which blocks the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking entry, preventing you from passing through. Deposit a coin or token in a slot and the arms are unlocked, allowing a single person to push through. After you pass through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.

^ A turnstile has two possible states: locked and unlocked. There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot and pushing the arm. In the locked state, pushing the arm has no effect no matter how many times you push; it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in shifts the state from locked to unlocked. In this state, putting in another coin has no effect, however you can now push the arm, which shifts the state back to locked.

## React Component States

- mutable
- self contained
- functionality centric

^ A React _state_ is a (_click_) mutable data store of components. The are (_click_) self contained, (_click_) functionality centric blocks of UI and logic.

^ Mutable means state values can change. By using state in a view (`render()`) and changing values later, you can affect the view's representation.

^ When state changes, _only_ the corresponding parts of views change, everything else in the DOM remains intact.

## Working With States

^ To be able to work with states, you need to know how to access values, update them and set the initial values.

---

## Using Hooks

^ Hooks is a feature that was introduced in React version 16.7 that has changed how we write React applications. Hooks allow function components to have state and respond to life cycle methods, which make class based components obsolete.

---

### `useState`

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

^ Using the `useState()` API, you can create a new state variable and have a way to alter it. `useState()` accepts the initial value of the state item and returns an array containing the state variable, and the function you call to alter the state. Since it returns an array we use array destructuring to access each individual item.

^ You can add add as many `useState()` calls as you want, to create as many state variables as you want.

^ [1] Flavio Copes _The React Handbook_ pg. 178

---

### Accessing Lifecycle Hooks

#### Class Component Lifecycle Methods

- `componentDidMount`
- `componentWillUnmount`
- `componentDidUpdate`

#### Hooks Lifecycle

- `useEffect`

^ Another important feature of Hooks is allowing function components to have access to lifecycle hooks. Class components can register functions to serve many cases.

^ Hooks provides the `useEffect` API. This function runs when the component is first rendered, and on every subsequent re-render/update. React first updates the DOM, then calls any function passed to `useEffect`.

^ [1] Flavio Copes _The React Handbook_ pg. 179

## Hooks `useState` and `useEffect` Examples

---

## Using Component Based State

---

### Accessing States

```javascript
this.state.name

render() {
  return <div>{this.state.currentTime}</div>
}
```

^ The `state` object is an attribute of a component that can be accessed with a `this` reference. Recall that we can access and print variables in JSX with curly braces. You can render state just like any other variable in the `render()` method.

---

## Stateless Components

^ A _stateless_ component has no states or components. The purpose of a stateless component is to render the view. It can take properties and do something to them. It's a simple function with input and output. We wrote a lot of stateless components in the first few lessons. Let's revisit our Hello World example.

---

### `HelloWorld` Class

```javascript
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1 {...this.props}>
        Hello {this.props.frameworkName}
      </h1>
    )
  }
}
```

---

### `HelloWorld` Stateless Component

```javascript
const HelloWorld = function(props) {
  return (
    <h1 {...props}>
      Hello {this.props.frameworkName}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

^ To provide a smaller syntax for stateless components, React uses a function style where you create a function that takes properties as an argument and returns the view.

---

### `HelloWorld` Stateless Component (ES6)

```javascript
const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  return (
    <h1 {...props}>
      Hello {this.props.frameworkName}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

^ You can use ES6 arrow functions for stateless components too.

---

### Stateless Component Benefits

- more declarative
- reduce duplication
- simpler (better) syntax

^ Stateless components are (_click_) more declarative and work better when all you need to do is render HTML. Stateless components (_click_) reduce duplication and provide (_click_) simpler syntax. The React team considers it to be a best practice to use stateless components wherever possible.

---

## State Example

^ Let's build a clock that uses state to update the current time in the view.

^ _03/clock-app_

---

## Updating State

```javascript
this.setState(data, callback);
```

^ You change state with the `this.setState(data, callback)` class method. When you call this method, React merges the data with current states and calls `render()`. After that, React calls `callback`.

^ Having the callback in `setState()` is important because the method works _asynchronously_. If you're relying on the new state, you can use the callback to make sure this new state is available.

^ _return to 03/clock-app_

---

## Component Lifecycle

^ React provides a way for you to control and customize a component's behavior based on its lifecycle events.

---

## Component Lifecycle Events

- mounting events
- updating events
- unmounting events

^ These events fall into the following categories:

^ mounting events: happen when a React element is attached to a DOM node

^ updating events: happen when a React element is updated as a result of new values of its properties or state

^ unmounting events: happen when a React element is detached from the DOM

---

### Triggering Lifecycle Events

^ Every React component has lifecycle events that are triggered at certain moments depending on what a component has done or will do. Some execute just once, others can be executed continuously.

^ You can use lifecycle events to modify the behaviour of components (for example, decide when to rerender the view). This enhances performance because unnecessary operations are eliminated.

---

![fit](images/component_lifecycle.png)

^ React defines several component events in three categories. _Mounting_ and _unmounting_ events are invoked once, but _updating_ events can be invoked many times.

---

### Categories of Events - Constructor

^ This diagram does not include the _constructor()_ method, which happens when an element is created and lets you set the default properties and initial state.

---

### Categories of Events - Mounting

- `componentWillMount()`
- `componentDidMount()`

^ `componentWillMount()` happens before mounting to the DOM

^ `componentDidMount()` happens after mounting and rendering

---

### Categories of Events - Updating

- `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)`
- `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
- `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
- `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`

^  `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)` happens when the component is about to receive properties

^  `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` this is a boolean that lets you optimize the component's rendering by determining when to update and when not to update

^  `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` happens right before the component is updated

^  `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)` happens right after the component is updated

---

### Categories of Events - Unmounting

- `componentWillUnmount()`

^ `componentWillUnmount()` lets you unbind and detach any event listeners or do other cleanup work before the component is unmounted.

---

## Implementing An Event

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    ...
  }
}
```

^ To implement lifecycle events, you define them on a class as methods. React checks to see whether there's a method with an event name; if React finds a method it will call that method. If the method is not defined, React will continue the normal flow and not execute any code for that method.

---

## Fetch API Example

^ Let's build an example of an app that uses props, state and a component lifecycle method. We'll use the Fetch API which lets us make an XHR request using promises. Let's check browser support _caniuse fetch_.

^ _03/fetch-app_
